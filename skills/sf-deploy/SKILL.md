# sf-deploy: Comprehensive Salesforce DevOps Automation

Use this skill when the user needs **deployment orchestration**: dry-run validation, targeted or manifest-based deploys, CI/CD workflow advice, scratch-org management, failure triage, or safe rollout sequencing for Salesforce metadata.

## When This Skill Owns the Task

Use `sf-deploy` when the work involves:
- `sf project deploy start`, `quick`, `report`, or retrieval workflows
- release sequencing across objects, permission sets, Apex, and Flows
- CI/CD gates, test-level selection, or deployment reports
- troubleshooting deployment failures and dependency ordering

Delegate elsewhere when the user is:
- authoring Apex or LWC code → [sf-apex](../sf-apex/SKILL.md), [sf-lwc](../sf-lwc/SKILL.md)
- creating metadata definitions → [sf-metadata](../sf-metadata/SKILL.md)
- building Flows → [sf-flow](../sf-flow/SKILL.md)
- doing org data operations → [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md)
- authoring Agent Script logic → [sf-ai-agentscript](../sf-ai-agentscript/SKILL.md)

---

## Critical Operating Rules

- Use **`sf` CLI v2 only**.
- On non-source-tracking orgs, deploy/retrieve commands require an explicit scope such as `--source-dir`, `--metadata`, or `--manifest`.
- Prefer **`--dry-run` first** before real deploys.
- For Flows, deploy safely and activate only after validation.

### Default deployment order
| Phase | Metadata |
|---|---|
| 1 | Custom objects / fields |
| 2 | Permission sets |
| 3 | Apex |
| 4 | Flows as Draft |
| 5 | Flow activation / post-verify |

This ordering prevents many dependency and FLS failures.

---

## Required Context to Gather First

Ask for or infer:
- target org alias and environment type
- deployment scope: source-dir, metadata list, or manifest
- whether this is validate-only, deploy, quick deploy, retrieve, or CI/CD guidance
- required test level and rollback expectations
- whether special metadata types are involved (Flow, permission sets, agents, packages)

Preflight checks:
```bash
sf --version
sf org list
sf org display --target-org <alias> --json
test -f sfdx-project.json
```

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Preflight
Confirm auth, repo shape, package directories, and target scope.

### 2. Validate first
```bash
sf project deploy start --dry-run --source-dir force-app --target-org <alias> --wait 30 --json
```
Use manifest- or metadata-scoped validation when the change set is targeted.

### 3. Deploy the smallest correct scope
```bash
# source-dir deploy
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app --target-org <alias> --wait 30 --json

# manifest deploy
sf project deploy start --manifest manifest/package.xml --target-org <alias> --test-level RunLocalTests --wait 30 --json

# quick deploy after successful validation
sf project deploy quick --job-id <validation-job-id> --target-org <alias> --json
```

### 4. Verify
```bash
sf project deploy report --job-id <job-id> --target-org <alias> --json
```
Then verify tests, Flow state, permission assignments, and smoke-test behavior.

### 5. Report clearly
Summarize what deployed, what failed, what was skipped, and what the next safe action is.

## High-Signal Failure Patterns

| Error / symptom | Likely cause | Default fix direction |
|---|---|---|
| `FIELD_CUSTOM_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION` | validation rule or bad test data | adjust data or rule timing |
| `INVALID_CROSS_REFERENCE_KEY` | missing dependency | include referenced metadata first |
| `CANNOT_INSERT_UPDATE_ACTIVATE_ENTITY` | trigger / Flow / validation side effect | inspect automation stack and failing logic |
| tests fail during deploy | broken code or fragile tests | run targeted tests, fix root cause, revalidate |
| field/object not found in permset | wrong order | deploy objects/fields before permission sets |
| Flow invalid / version conflict | dependency or activation problem | deploy as Draft, verify, then activate |

## CI/CD Guidance

Default pipeline shape:
1. authenticate
2. validate repo / org state
3. static analysis
4. dry-run deploy
5. tests + coverage gates
6. deploy
7. verify + notify

Static analysis now uses **Code Analyzer v5** (`sf code-analyzer`), not retired `sf scanner`.

## Agentforce Deployment Note

Use this skill to orchestrate **deployment/publish sequencing** around agents, but use the agent-specific skills for authoring decisions:
- [sf-ai-agentscript](../sf-ai-agentscript/SKILL.md) for `.agent` authoring and validation
- [sf-ai-agentforce](../sf-ai-agentforce/SKILL.md) for Agent Builder / PromptTemplate / metadata config

For full agent DevOps details, including `Agent:` pseudo metadata, publish/activate, and sync-between-orgs, see:
- [references/agent-deployment-guide.md](references/agent-deployment-guide.md)

## Cross-Skill Integration

| Need | Delegate to | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| custom object / field creation | [sf-metadata](../sf-metadata/SKILL.md) | define metadata before deploy |
| Apex compile / review / fixes | [sf-apex](../sf-apex/SKILL.md) | code authoring and repair |
| Flow creation / repair | [sf-flow](../sf-flow/SKILL.md) | Flow authoring and activation guidance |
| test data or seed records | [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md) | realistic validation data |
| Agent Script build/publish readiness | [sf-ai-agentscript](../sf-ai-agentscript/SKILL.md) | agent-specific correctness |
